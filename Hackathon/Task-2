Based on the given information, the best next step would be to rerun the regression of survival outcomes against the four significant variables: gender, number of siblings abroad, ticket class, and number of parents abroad. Then, we can take the residuals from that regression and regress them against passenger_age. This approach allows us to investigate the relationship between passenger_age and survival while accounting for the significant variables. The rationale behind this approach is that passenger_age might still have some effect on survival outcomes, but its significance was overshadowed by the other four variables. By isolating the effects of these significant variables first, we can better understand the remaining impact of passenger_age on survival. Re-running the regression with the four significant variables and examining the residuals against passenger_age allows us to explore whether the passenger_age has any independent predictive power for survival once the effects of the other significant variables have been accounted for. Therefore, the recommended next step is to rerun the regression of survival outcomes against gender, number of siblings abroad, ticket class, and number of parents abroad. Then, take the residuals from that regression and regress them against passenger_age.
